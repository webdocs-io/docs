2. Click `Create Site from Github Repo` to create a site from your Github repo. If you don't have a Github repo yet, go to [Github](https://www.github.com) and create a repository. [Click here](https://help.github.com/articles/create-a-repo/) to read more on how to create a repository on Github.

3. When the site has been created, you should be redirected to the `index.md` page. That page is the start page of your site. If the page already exists, you can edit it by clicking the `Edit` button in the upper left corner. If the page doesn't exist, you will be prompted with an editor where you can write the content for your start page and save it.
